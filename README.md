YohaQr is a PHP Composer package that provides a simple, fluent API for generating QR codes using the latest [Endroid QR Code](https://github.com/endroid/qr-code) library. With QR Easy you can easily customize your QR codes with features such as:

- **Custom Data:** Encode any text or URL.
- **Adjustable Size and Margin:** Configure the overall size and surrounding margin.
- **Error Correction & Encoding:** Choose error correction levels and character encoding.
- **Logo Integration:** Add a custom logo (with optional resizing and background punchout).
- **Labeling:** Optionally add a label with a custom font and alignment.

```

```
I am working on examples!
```

### Logo Feature

When using the logo feature, simply provide a valid file path via the `setLogoPath()` method. Optionally, you can resize the logo using `setLogoResizeToWidth()` and remove the background behind the logo with `setLogoPunchoutBackground()`.

## Running Tests

QR Easy uses PHPUnit for unit testing. To run the tests, install PHPUnit (if you havenâ€™t already) and execute:

```bash
you need to install phpunit test to try this but I am preparing cli 
```

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap vendor/autoload.php tests
```
